## Introduction

MyBook is a project inspired by Facebook, designed to provide a high-level user experience similar to the real Facebook platform. It allows users to create accounts, connect with friends, share posts, and interact with each other just like they would on Facebook.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users must sign in to access the platform, and they can use their real Facebook credentials for a seamless login experience.
  
- **Guest Sign-In:** A guest sign-in functionality allows visitors to explore the platform without creating an account or providing credentials.

- **Friend Requests:** Users can send and accept friend requests, enabling them to connect with other users.

- **Post Creation:** Users can create text-based and image posts to share their thoughts and experiences with their friends.

- **Likes and Comments:** Users can like and comment on posts to interact with the content.

- **Homepage:** The homepage displays recent posts from the users friends, mimicking Facebook's "Timeline" feature.

- **Profile Creation:** Users can create profiles, complete with profile photos, to personalize their accounts.

- **Profile Photo Updates:** Users can upload and update their profile photos as they see fit.
